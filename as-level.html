                <h1>Background and Introduction</h1>
                <p class="mb-4">Over the past few years, the internet has continued to
                    evolve and expand, which is why it is extremely
                    important to understand the underlying infrastructures
                    that support it. In order to understand the complexity
                    of the internet, mapping the logical and physical
                    topology of internet infrastructures and visualizing
                    them can provide valuable information into the
                    network’s performance and potential bottlenecks</p>
                <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                <p>Although various visualization platforms are
                    constantly being developed and refined for internet
                    topology visualization, there is still a need for further
                    research into the internet topology of Africa. This is
                    mainly due to little research being done in
                    visualizations tools specifically for the African
                    Internet topology. The tools that have been described
                    in previous research do not effectively communicate
                    the interconnections in the African internet topology.
                    Mapping the internet topology in Africa presents
                    unique challenges due to Africa’s limited internet
                    infrastructures and diverse geography. Therefore,
                    it is necessary to collect BGP datasets and traceroute
                    measurements for logical topology discovery and use
                    it to infer and visualize the relationships between
                    networks and countries across Africa </p>
                <p>By visualizing the relationships between networks in
                    Africa; network experts or users who are interested in
                    internet networks can learn more about their ISPs.
                    Such a visualization would be useful in identifying
                    what kind of relationships do their ISPs have with
                    other ISPs and at which internet exchange point (IXP)
                    do they exchange data with each other.</p>
                <h1>Research Aim</h1>
                <p>Many researchers have tried to use various techniques
                    and datasets such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
                    datasets and traceroute measurements to map internet
                    topology and visualize the relationships between
                    internet service providers (ISPs) across the world.
                    Despite various approaches to mapping internet
                    topology, the visualization platforms that have been
                    developed in previous research are difficult to use and
                    users often struggle to understand the data that are
                    being visualized due to its complicated nature. One
                    of the possible reasons for this is most of the
                    visualization tools focus more on how appealing the
                    visualizations should be instead of presenting useful
                    information to the viewers. Another possible reason is
                    that some visualization tools lack essential features
                    such as allowing the viewers to filter and find what
                    they want to see. These flaws have either made the
                    visualization tools to become less useful or difficult to
                    comprehend.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of visualization tools is to present
                    information in a visual and interactive manner.
                    The visualizations should allow users to extract useful
                    information easily such as identifying the ISPs and the
                    relationships between ISPs. Such visualizations should
                    also be simple and easy to use, especially for users
                    who have never used any visualization tools before.
                    The following research question has been formulated
                    for this project: How can the visualization of
                    interconnections between ISPs effectively
                    communicate the AS level internet topology of Africa,
                    allowing users to identify ISPs, exchange points and
                    peering links, and how the visualization is able to
                    improve its usability and accuracy to extract useful
                    information?</p>
                <h1>Results</h1>
                <p>The accuracy of visual queries is determined by
                    whether participants can answer questions related to
                    the visual queries correctly. If participants are able to
                    answer the questions correctly, they have successfully
                    performed the given tasks. </p>

                <p>In figure 1, results showed that participants were able
                    to determine which node is AS or IXP in the topology
                    visualization with 100% accuracy. Another visual
                    query achieved 100% accuracy is identifying the type
                    of relationships each AS may have. However, the last
                    visual query was answered with less accuracy which
                    only had 88.8% accuracy.</p>

                <p>All the participants were able to answer the first two
                    visual queries (Visual query 1 and 2) without any
                    issues. This is because the answers to visual query 1
                    and 2 focus on the use of colours in the visualization.
                    However, for visual query 3, participants find it difficult
                    to determine the number of customers for a particular AS due
                    to the size of nodes.</p>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="./img/VisualQueries.JPG" class="image">
                </div>

                <p>Figure 2 shows that task 3 (Search for a specific AS)
                    and task 4 (Zoom into AS by clicking on AS name in
                    the list) had 100% successful task completion while
                    task 1 and 2 nearly achieved 100% successful task
                    completion. In comparison to these tasks, task 5 has
                    the lowest completion percentage. This is understandable since task 5 needs to answer visual
                    query 3 in figure 4.</p>

                <P>Tasks 3 and 4 were easy to perform due to the simple
                    tasks that each participant needed to perform. The reasons for the lower completion percentage for
                    tasks 1 and 2 are interactivity issues. These tasks
                    require participants to interact with the nodes in the
                    visualization. In task 5, participants were tasked with finding the AS
                    with most customers (largest node). This resulted in a
                    few responses where participants struggled to find AS
                    with most customers. </P>
